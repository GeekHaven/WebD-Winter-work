<h1>My Projects</h1>
<ol>
	<li id = "pr1"><p>GSM Based Fire Alert System:<br>
		An Arduino based project which uses LM35 Temperature Sensor to detect fire or spark presence in ambient environment. Sends a text SMS message uing SIM900 GSM Module to designated phones numbers as soon as fire threshold is overridden.</p>
	</li>
	<li id = "pr2"><p>Smart Home Automation:<br>
		An Arduino based project which controls 4 channel SPDT relay module over a bluetooth network limited in a house range. Bluetooth network created by HC-05 Module setups communication bridge between arduino serial port and custom made android app. </p>
	</li>
	<li id = "pr3"><p>Automatic Sentry Gun:<br>
		An Arduino based Defence project which fires a toy gun as soon as it detects a obstruction in specific radius. Toy gun is mounted on a stepper motor along with HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect obstruction. Fire Mechanism of gun is controlled by servo.</p>
