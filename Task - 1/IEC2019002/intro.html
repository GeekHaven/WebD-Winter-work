<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
Myself Tejas Agrawal(virtually known as cyber-venom003), an undergraduate student from Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I belong from Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
</p>
<p>I completed my schooling in Jodhpur itself. From high school itself, I developed an interest towards electronics and related fields. In this reference, I experienced the highly interesting 
world of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Due to this interest, I developed my real world interacting projects to solve our practical problems. Iâ€™ve also developed some of the projects related to IoT.</p>
<p>Other than a microcontroller hobbyist, I also love to do Competitive Programming. In college itself, I also developed my interest in Open Source Development and Graphic Designing.</p>
<p>Other than this, I also love to play FPS PC games like CS:GO, Call Of Duty WWII and Crysis.</p>
