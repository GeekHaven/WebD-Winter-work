		Hey! this is 
		<b>Tanish Agarwal</b>
		aka capt_titanium (that's just what i call myself on social media and games, however it has no logic). Well, putting that aside, I am currently pursuing my 
		<b>B.tech in electronics and communication from IIIT-Allahabad</b>. 
		I like to code in C and C++ specifically, because I've been doing so from 9th grade and been recognised as a good coder back in my school days!.
		<br><br>
		Now, I have started focusing 
		on more wings like web development, app development, foss and design. I believe that I will make a great engineer some day.
		I love music and hence am a part of the music society of my college. I also have a habit of drawing anime and manga
		(japanese cartoons which less people see) and so, much figuratively I am also a part of the fine arts society of my college.
		<br><br>
		As for my educational background I have studied in Delhi Public School Agra till 10th grade after which I did a 2 year coaching at Resonance Agra for the goal of clearing JEE. That's all I have as an introductory of myself. Thanks for viewing!
