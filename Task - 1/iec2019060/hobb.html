	<p class="details"> 
		I have a vast range of hobbies. Let me just list them out one-by-one :-
		<br><br>
		<b>1. MUSIC</b>
		<br><br>
		I simply love music. I can't imagine how terrible my first 2 months of college were when I wasn't a part of the music society.  I am learning drums right now and I can play a mandolin (remember DDLJ?), a congo and many other small rhythmic instruments. I have learnt classical music in my school.

		<b>2. ARTS</b>
		<br> <br>
		I am one of those anime lovers you find rarely but a rather smaller one. I have great love for naruto and dragon ball z. Naruto being my ideal character. I draw a lot of manga (which every FAS member is familiar with). I am particularly a sketcher but I am trying to expand my area of expertise even further!
		<br><br>
		<b>3. CODING</b>
		<br><br>
		I love the logic , however, it's gonna take me some time to settle into the syntax part. I think that if I put a little more effort into coding I can come out to be a good coder.
		<br><br>
		<b>4. BASKETBALL</b>
		<br><br>
		I like to play basketball as I have played a lot with my elder brother since childhood. I don't have a lot of interest into sports but this one is an exception.
