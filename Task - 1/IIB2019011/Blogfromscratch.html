	<p class="title">The Beginning</p>
	<div><p class="first">So I just stumbled upon the slack channel made by seniors.</p> 
	<p>It was created in order to make our december vacation a bit productive by making us learn some new sklls like web developement, software developement and understanding github for open source software.I have decided to learn web developement form scratch and as way to test my skills I have decided make this blog. </p></div>

	<p class="title">The Learning Begins</p>
	<div><p class="first">HTML beginning and intermeediate done</p> 
	<p>Thanks to amazing link provided by seniors for a web developement course I have finsished html basics and intermediate to a decent level even though I still don't know how to style my website</p></div>

	<p class="title">Style of a Webpage</p>
	<div><p class="first">I just finished learning CSS basics</p> 
	<p>So the problem of styling that I have been facing can be resolved easily by CSS.Even though my webpage are nowhere looking 'decent' I think I am making progress just by the changing background of my webpage. </p></div>

	<p class="title">The Idea</h2>
	<p class="first">It seems that I have learned minimal css and html requires to start building my website form scratch and this one of the first proect,the blog site, that I think I will work on a coming months or so.</p>
	<p>Amazing thing about the tasks given in link from google drive is that you can actually continue it further. For example take this blog site. Main idea is that I will be combining this blog site with my main porfolio site and voila, my task for this week is completed in the span of 4 days.</p>
