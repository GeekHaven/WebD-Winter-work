		I originally belong to Jaipur, Rajasthan where I was born and brought up. I completed my high schooling from Neerja Modi School. I am currently pursuing a bachelors course in Information Technology from IIIT Allahabad and even though I do not know the first thing about it, I hope to someday become an ethical hacker<br><br>

		I love reading novels, fiction mostly and am a great fan of Dan Brown and Paula Hawkins as their books are simply mindblowing. I also am fond of listening to music, especially that of Maroon 5, Green Day and Amit Trivedi, and like playing lawn tennis and basketball.

		In my school, I had Information Practices as my optional subject and that introduced me to Java. I learnt Java and Database Management in 11th and 12th grade and made a cab booking software with an integrated database as a project for the 12th boards. I recently started working on android development and speaking from the little experience that I have, I found it to be quite intriguing. I also find Hacking interesting, but maybe that's just because of how cool it seems in movies and books and T.V shows.

		I am currently trying to hone my Web development and android development skills and I want to take them to a decent level.<span> And if I do</span> (which seems really tough, seeing my current record), I wish to start working on a freelance project right away and hopefully get a decent pay and also a chance to further improve my skills.
